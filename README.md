A lightweight 2D top-down combat game prototype made in Unity.  
- **Player Combat**  
  - Basic melee attack  
  - Health system  
  - Knockback on hit
   **Level Design**  
  - Tile-based map for combat arena  
  - Obstacles / walls placed on map  

- **Game Systems**  
  - Game Manager (tracking player health, restart on death)  
  - Event-driven interactions (player hit, enemy death)  
  - Modular architecture: scripts separated by responsibility (Movement, Combat, AI, UI, etc.)

- **UI**  
  - Health bar for player
